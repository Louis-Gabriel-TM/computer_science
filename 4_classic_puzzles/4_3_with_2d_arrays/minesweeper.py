"""
Puzzle Wording
==============
Write a function that assigns the correct number in a field of Minesweeper (VF: jeu du d√©mineur), which is represented as a list of lists (2 dimensional array).

Inputs:
------
'bombs': a list with the bomb locations.
'nb_rows': the number of rows in the field.
'nb_cols': the number of columns in the field.

Example:
-------
Input:  bombs = [[0, 0], [0, 1]], nb_rows = 3, nb_cols = 4
Ouput:  [[-1, -1, 1, 0],
         [2, 2, 1, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0]]
