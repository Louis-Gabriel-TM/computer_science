# Problem Solving Techniques

### Problem Solving in 5 steps

#### 1. Understand the Problem

Some questions to consider first:

- Can I restate the problem?
- What are the inputs? their types? their boundaries?
- What outputs should come from the solution?
- Have I enough informations to solve the problem?
- How should I label the data that are parts of the problem?

#### 2. Explore Concrete Examples

- Start with simple examples.
- Progress to more complex examples.
- Explore extreme examples like empty inputs.
- Explore examples with invalid inputs (particularly important in real project, to build a robust solution).

#### 3. Break It Down!

#### 4. Solve or Simplify

#### 5. Look Back and Refactor

### For Coding Interviews

##### _"Think like on paper"_

Before coding, imagine **how you may solve the problem on paper**. In the given case and in **extended cases** (bigger input, extreme inputs, ...).

Then think about **the right data structure** to use.

##### _"Big picture first, then details"_

##### _"Communicate well with the interviewer"_

Verbalize your reflexions during the interview and ask for help if necessary.
