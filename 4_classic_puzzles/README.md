# Problem Solving Techniques

### For Coding Interviews

##### _"Think like on paper"_

Before coding, imagine **how you may solve the problem on paper**. In the given case and in **extended cases** (bigger input, extreme inputs, ...).

Then think about **the right data structure** to use.

##### _"Big picture first, then details"_

##### _"Communicate well with the interviewer"_

Verbalize your reflexions during the interview and ask for help if necessary.
