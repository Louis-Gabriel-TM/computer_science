Five design principles brought out by Robert C. Martin (aka "Uncle Bob") in 2000:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle

- **O**pen-Closed Principle

- **L**iskov Substitution Principle

- **I**nterface Segregation Principle

- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

A class should have one unique responsibility.

Similar to the **_Separation of Concerns (SOC)_** principle.

**Illustration:** `srp.py`

**Anti-pattern:** God objects
